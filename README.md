ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yew Young. 

ðŸ“– I'm a 3rd Year BEng. student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in analytics - Especially predictive and prescriptive modelling - because I love seeing how data-driven improvements directly impact daily decisions. The tools I primarily use are Python, R, SQL and Power BI.  

ðŸŒ± I recently worked on [optimizing driver assignments for a food delivery business](https://github.com/yynijo/Revenue-Optimization-model-for-Food-Delivery-Service) as part of an academic project.

ðŸ’¼ I continuously strengthen my analytical foundation. I volunteer as a Teaching Assistant at my University teaching multivariable calculus, linear algebra, probabability & statistics.

ðŸŽ­ I'm passionate about storytelling. I've collaborated with Singapore Polytechnic on a promotional video that garnered 11,000 views. I also shared my summer program experience at Aalto University Espoo in a school-wide event.
